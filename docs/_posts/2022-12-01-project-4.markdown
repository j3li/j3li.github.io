### What I Did
- Developed a web application that is capable of extracting, organizing, and formatting text from a video file that is uploaded to the platform.
- Implemented pre-processing techniques using **Python** to optimize the accuracy of extracting text and numerical data from images.
- Established a custom algorithm to match extracted names from **Tesseract** with a pre-created list of names, streamlining data processing and reducing errors by 25%.

### What I Used
Python, Git, Tesseract, Flask, HTML
